# Social Networking Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the social networking feature for the Regret Regret app, allowing users to follow each other and view real-time regret management progress.

## 1. Database Schema Changes ✅

### Updated User Model
- Added `allow_networking` field (Boolean, default=True)
- Added `followers_count` field (PositiveInteger, default=0)
- Added `following_count` field (PositiveInteger, default=0)
- Added `get_regret_index()` method for calculating daily regret scores

### New Network Model
- `follower`: ForeignKey to User (who is following)
- `following`: ForeignKey to User (who is being followed)
- `created_at`: DateTimeField for relationship timestamp
- Automatic count updates on save/delete operations
- Database indexes for performance optimization

## 2. API Endpoints Implementation ✅

### Network Validation
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/network/validate/<username>/`
- **Purpose**: Validate username before following
- **Features**: Checks self-following, existing relationships, networking permissions

### Follow User
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/network/follow/<username>/`
- **Purpose**: Create follow relationship
- **Features**: Prevents duplicates, validates permissions, updates counts

### Unfollow User
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/network/unfollow/<username>/`
- **Purpose**: Remove follow relationship
- **Features**: Validates existing relationship, updates counts

### Network Lists
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/network/list/<list_type>/`
- **Purpose**: Get following/followers with regret indexes
- **Features**: Supports both "following" and "followers" list types
- **Data**: Includes real-time regret indexes for today

### Network Settings
- **Endpoint**: `PATCH /api/network/settings/`
- **Purpose**: Update user's networking preferences
- **Features**: Toggle `allow_networking` setting

## 3. Serializers ✅

### Updated UserSerializer
- Includes networking fields and counts
- Maintains backward compatibility

### New NetworkSerializer
- Handles network relationship data
- Includes username fields for easy frontend consumption

### New NetworkUserSerializer
- Optimized for network list responses
- Includes regret indexes and user stats

## 4. Admin Interface ✅

### UserAdmin
- Displays networking fields
- Shows follower/following counts
- Read-only count fields

### NetworkAdmin
- Manages follow relationships
- Searchable by usernames
- Filterable by creation date

### ChecklistAdmin & RegretAdmin
- Enhanced with better display and filtering

## 5. Error Handling & Validation ✅

### HTTP Status Codes
- 200: Success
- 400: Bad request (invalid username, etc.)
- 401: Unauthorized (invalid/missing JWT)
- 403: Forbidden (networking disabled)
- 404: User not found
- 409: Conflict (already following, self-following)
- 500: Server error

### Error Messages
- "User not found"
- "This user has networking disabled"
- "You are already following this user"
- "You cannot follow yourself"
- "Invalid username format"
- "Network operation failed"

## 6. Security & Performance ✅

### Security Features
- JWT authentication required for all endpoints
- User permission validation
- Parameterized queries (Django ORM)
- Input validation and sanitization

### Performance Optimizations
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Efficient JOIN queries with select_related
- Optimized regret index calculations
- Atomic operations for count updates

## 7. Integration Points ✅

### User Settings
- `allow_networking` field controls visibility
- Default value: TRUE for existing users
- Can be toggled via API endpoint

### Checklist Integration
- Regret indexes accessible for network queries
- Timezone-aware date calculations
- Consistent with existing scoring logic

## 8. Usage Examples

### Follow a User
```bash
POST /api/network/follow/johndoe/
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

### Get Following List with Regret Indexes
```bash
GET /api/network/list/following/
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

### Update Networking Settings
```bash
PATCH /api/network/settings/
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "allow_networking": false
}
```

## 9. Next Steps

### Database Migration
```bash
cd app
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Testing
- Test all endpoints with valid/invalid data
- Verify error handling and status codes
- Test timezone handling for regret indexes
- Validate count updates on follow/unfollow

### Frontend Integration
- Implement follow/unfollow buttons
- Display network lists with regret indexes
- Add networking settings toggle
- Show follower/following counts

## 10. Technical Notes

### Regret Index Calculation
- Uses existing checklist scoring system
- Timezone-aware for global users
- Cached per user per day
- Fallback to 1.0 if no checklist exists

### Count Management
- Automatic updates via model save/delete overrides
- Atomic operations prevent race conditions
- Efficient database queries

### Performance Considerations
- Database indexes on network relationships
- Optimized queries with select_related
- Minimal database hits for regret indexes

This implementation provides a robust foundation for social networking features while maintaining the existing app's architecture and performance characteristics.
